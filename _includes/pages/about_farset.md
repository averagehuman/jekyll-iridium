### Who We Are
We are a inclusive group of students, professionals, academics, freelancers, artists, hackers, and organizers that believe strongly in experimental learning and the Do-It-Yourself ethic. We facilitate technology initiatives and encourage hands-on learning by maintaining an open workshop and creative space that is available to all. We maintain an inclusive membership policy, and strive to apply the principles of the open-software and open-hardware movements within our design policies. In short, we are an immersive experiment into the hacker ethic.
