**Date &#8211; 16th November**  
**Time &#8211; 1pm to 5pm**  

**Raspberry Jam** is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet regularly to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their Raspberry Pi to good use. While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors will be expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.

**You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi** to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one. We may even have a few spare you can use on the day.

## Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:

*  A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi
*  Getting started with Hardware interfaces to the Raspberry Pi with flashy lights and ScratchGPIO
*  Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s
*  Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.

Children are very welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.

We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, but please try and BYO monitor. We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.
  
If you have an awesome pi project you have been working on, we would love you to bring it along and show it off in the show and tell.

<strong>THIS EVENT IS IN HIGH DEMAND SO PLEASE BOOK AHEAD OF TIME TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT</strong>
