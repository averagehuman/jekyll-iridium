Our long running, [Ignite][1] / [Petcha Kutcha][2] -minus-the-presentations-plus-a-giant-blackboard-and-foam-projectiles speaker series is back, with a slightly festive feel! Normal rules apply; Speakers have 7 minutes to talk about something they&#8217;re passionate about, with audience heckling encouraged, and the opportunity for a few more minutes of Q&A after at the compères discretion. This time around, the wonderful [Claire Wilgar ][3]will be compère-ing (we expect Christmas Hats!) and for a change we have a rough idea of whose talking!

*   [Jiann Hughes](http://jiannhughes.com/) will be talking about her work in the intersection between Art, Culture, and Technology
*   Colin Kelsey/Matt Hazely will be explaining some of the beer brewing techniques they are experimenting with in the labs
*   Will Burr from Billy Goat Entertainment will be demoing some of his currently-[Kickstarting](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1236117571/her-majestys-spiffing) game, Her Majesty&#8217;s Spiffing
*   Dr David Laverty, for Queen&#8217;s University Belfast&#8217;s Energy, Power and Intelligent Systems (EPIC) group, who are working on[ converting a classic DeLorean to an Electric drive train](https://www.facebook.com/QUBEV)
*   Sebastian Heinz from SARC will **hopefully** be demoing his wildly successful [Patchblocks](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2012099678/patchblocks-programmable-mini-synth-modules) project that has already obliterated its £10k funding goal
*   We&#8217;ll also **hopefully** have a visit from some developers from [Aepona](http://www.aepona.com), a locally based API-as-a-service company recently acquired by [Intel](http://www.aepona.com/intel-and-aepona/)
*   Finally, we&#8217;re **hoping** to get a short talk on some of the work done by PWC&#8217;s Belfast Based Digital Forensic Team

As always, we try to keep a few slots open for walk ins, so if you feel inspired to talk about something, let us know! Drinks and munchies are provided by the brilliant folks at the [British Computing Society](http://www.bcs.org/category/10444), who have supported us throughout our <a title="Gathering of Lightning" href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk/blog/gathering-of-lightening/" target="_blank">Gathering of Lightning</a> programme for the past year and a half.
