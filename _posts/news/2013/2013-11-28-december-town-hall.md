Our next Town Hall meeting is scheduled for Monday 2nd December at 7pm in the Event Space\* at Farset.

We&#8217;ll be discussing a variety of issues, as well as giving an update on the work occurring in the space. If you have any questions or concerns, email us at <admin@farsetlabs.org.uk> and we&#8217;ll add them to the agenda to be brought up. Afterwards, the minutes will be made available here. **EDIT: Link to minutes is [here][1].**

\*We&#8217;ll move to the Lounge/Co-working Space if the renovations are affecting the Event Space.
